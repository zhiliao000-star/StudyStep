You are a senior mobile app developer.

Build a cross-platform mobile app called “StudyStep”.

   - Ask at the end: “Would you like me to explain this another way or try a similar problem?”

4. Response Screen:
   - Display AI explanation in readable format
   - Use numbered steps
   - Allow user to ask a follow-up question

   - Show a message when limit is reached
